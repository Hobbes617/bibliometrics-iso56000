2022-09-08 - There are 1298 words.

I include the new words that were not on the original list beginning at line 1299. However, they must be excluded from the current analysis.

2022-09-09 - I included the words: -LSB-; e.g.; entry; ISO; note; SOURCE; a); b); c); d); e); f); g); h); i) || 1298 + 15 = 1313 mots.
